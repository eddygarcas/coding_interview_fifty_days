package main

//In the context of binary trees, DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search)
//are two fundamental tree traversal algorithms â€” each explores the tree in a different order:
//DFS explores as deep as possible down one branch before backtracking.
//BFS visits nodes level by level, from top to bottom and left to right.

//| Feature     | DFS                           | BFS                        |
//| ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
//| Approach    | Go deep first                 | Visit level by level       |
//| Data Struct | Stack / Recursion             | Queue                      |
//| Memory      | Less if tree is deep          | More if tree is wide       |
//| Use Cases   | Path finding, tree properties | Shortest path, level order |
